Sara is our virtual therapist which helps you to monitor your day, and providing motivation to keep up with your day.
Sara also has a few more features than that and the developers are working to add more features in the future.

For Sara to run properly on your device, it is recommended to use Python Version 3.8.1+.
First time users are requested to install all the modules present in the requirements.txt they can do it manually or simply
by running "pip install -r requirements.txt" by opening cmd in Sara's Directory.

Have fun playing with Sara.
